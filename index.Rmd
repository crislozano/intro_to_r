## What is R?

<div style="float:right">
  <img width='100' src="./assets/img/fill.png">
  <img width='300' src="./assets/img/confundido.png">
</div>

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
- GNU project

---

## R environment

</div>

--- .segue bg:grey

# Object oriented programming

---

## Object oriented programming

> [...] language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather 
> than logic.

- The console
- R as a calculator
- Scripting language and objects

---

## The console

<div>
  <img width='100%' src="./assets/img/console1.png">
</div>

<p></p>

> - Gross
- Unintuitive
- Unproductive

--- &twocol2

## R as a calculator

<div style="float:right">
  <img width='350' src="./assets/img/programmer.jpeg">
</div>

*** {name: left}

- You can do simple arithmetic using the console

```{r calculator}
2 + 2
4^2
(12 * 15) / 2
```

<p></p>

> - Like using a ferrari to get the mail

---

## Scripting language

### R is a scripting language

<div>
  <img width='100%' src="./assets/img/rstudio2.png">
</div>

</br>

- Write code in .R file
- Send code to the console by highlighting in and typing **cmd** + **enter**
- Open the script 'introR.R' (File > Open file) and send some code to the console!

---

## Scripting language

### Comment your code

- You can include comments in your code by placing # at the beginning
- This is important so that you remember what you did and why!

```{r comments}
# This is a comment
2 + 2
```

---

## Scripting language

### OOP uses objects 

- Objects are variables saved into your computers memory
- You assign objects to variables using ```<-```

```{r objects}
x <- 2
print(x)
```

- You can then refer to and manipulate variables

```{r objects2}
x + 4
```

---

## Scripting language

### Functions

- The way we get things done in R is via functions
- A function in a command that performs an operation
	- ```sum()```
	- ```mean()```
	- ```lm()```
- Functions take arguements
	- ```sum(x)``` = calculate the sum of the values in the vector 'x'
	- ```mean(x)``` = calculate the mean of the values in the vector 'x'
	- ```lm(y ~ x)``` = fit a linear model ('y' as a function of 'x')
- ```R``` has many, many functions
- If you can't find one that does what you want, you can create it and share it in an R package (i.e. ```lingStuff```)

# Data structures

---

## Data structures

### R uses several different types of data structures  
We will focus on three

1. Vectors
2. Matrices
3. Dataframes

---

## Vectors

- A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type
- They commonly include chars or numbers

```{r vectors1}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)
z <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
print(x); print(y); print(z)
```

--- &twocol3

## Vectors

*** {name: left}

### We can perform operations on vectors

```{r vectors2}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)
x + 1
x + y
```

*** {name: right}

### ... but they have to be the same type of vector

```{r vectors3}
y + z
```

--- &twocol2

## Matrices

<div style="float:right">
  <img width='350' src="./assets/img/matrix.jpg"> </br>
  <img width='250' src="./assets/img/matrix2.png">
</div>

*** {name: left}

- A matrix is a two dimensional vector

```{r, 'matrix1'}
matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
```
</br>

- For most purposes, a matrix is not very convenient

---

## Dataframes

- A dataframe is a matrix with column names

```{r dataframe1}
testDF <- data.frame(x, y, z)
print(testDF)
```

- R comes with some dataframes installed
- Try using the command ```head()``` with the following dataframes
	- ```head(mtcars)```
	- ```head(USArrests)```

---

```{r dataframe2}
head(mtcars); head(USArrests)
```

# Manipulating dataframes

---

## Manipulating dataframes

- This is probably the hardest thing you have to learn to do in R (when you first start)!
- We can refer to rows and columns inside a dataframe using brackets ```[]```
- Let's create a data frame in order to practice

```{r dataframe3}
set.seed(1)
x <- seq(1:30)
g <- gl(n = 2, k = 15, length = 30, labels = c('females', 'males'))
y.iq <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 115, sd = 25)
y.wt <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 170, sd = 50)
y.ht <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 60, sd = 15)


df <- data.frame(subj = x, 
                 group = g, 
                 iq = y.iq, 
                 wt = sort(y.wt), 
                 ht = sort(y.ht)) 
```

---

## Manipulating dataframes

- Let's look at 'df' using the ```head()``` function

```{r checkdf}
head(df, n = 10) 
```

---

## Manipulating dataframes

- What kind of variables does the dataframe have?

```{r strDF}
str(df) 
```

---

## Manipulating dataframes

- How do we look at subsets of the dataframe? **Bracket operators** 

```{r bracket1}
df[1, ]  
```

```{r bracket2}
df[, 1]  
```

>- Show me the 10th row of the 3rd column
>- ```df[10, 3]```

---

## Manipulating dataframes

```{r bracket3}
df[10, 3]  
```

```{r bracket4}
df[10:15, ]  
```

---

## Manipulating dataframes

- We can also use levels of the categorical factor to subset and perform
and operation on the result
- Give me the average IQ of just the males 

```{r bracket5}
mean(df[df$group == 'males', 'iq']) 
```

<p></p>

>- **What is the mean height of the females?**
- **What is the mean weight of all participants?**
- **What is the standard deviation (```sd()```) of the weight of all participants?**

---

## Manipulating dataframes

```{r meanweight}
mean(df[df$group == 'females', 'ht'])
mean(df[, 'wt'])
sd(df[, 'wt'])
```

# Data visualization

---

## ggplot2

- ```ggplot2``` is a package that simplifies data visualization
- 'Grammar of graphics'
- Princple components
	- aesthetics (variables in your dataframe)  
	i.e. x, y, size, colour, shape
    - geoms (the type of elements in the plot)  
    i.e. points, boxplots, lines, etc.
- Let's plot the data from the ```df``` dataframe

```
ggplot(df, aes(x = ht, y = wt)) + 
geom_point() 
```

---

## ggplot2

```{r plotHTWT1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=12, fig.retina=2}
ggplot(df, aes(x = ht, y = wt)) + 
geom_point() + 
theme_bw(base_size = 18) 
```

---

## ggplot2

>- Try plotting the same data with a line instead (hint: use ```geom_line()```)
- Now try combining the points and the line
- Add a smoother to the plot (```geom_smooth()```)

---

## ggplot

- Let's look at our dataframe ```df``` with the categorical factor ```group```

```
df %>%
  gather(., key = variables, value = value, -subj, -group) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = variables, y = value, fill = group)) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

## ggplot 

```{r dfPlot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=12, fig.retina=2}
df %>%
  gather(., key = variables, value = value, -subj, -group) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = variables, y = value, fill = group)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1') + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 18) 
```

--- .segue bg:grey

# Data analysis

---

## Data analysis

- There are many packages created for R that make it possible to do a wide 
range of sophisticated analyses
- linear models, hierarchical (mixed effects) models, random forests, Bayesian models, etc.
- Most models use a function (i.e. ```lm()```) and the model is fit using a formula

```
lm(formula = wt ~ ht, data = df)
```

</br>

```{r lm, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis', cache=FALSE}
library(xtable)
df %>%
	lm(wt ~ ht, data = .) %>%
	xtable(.) %>% 
	print(., type = "html")
```

---

## Data analysis

```{r plotHTWT2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=12, fig.retina=2}
ggplot(df, aes(x = ht, y = wt, size = iq)) + 
geom_point(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) +
geom_point(size = 1, colour = 'red', show.legend = FALSE) +
geom_smooth(method = 'lm', show.legend = FALSE) + 
theme_bw(base_size = 18) 
```

# Reproducible research

---

## Reproducible research

- Scientific research must be reproducible
- Scientists are forgetful
- We need a workflow that facilitates reproducibility *and* helps us remember what we did

>- **Solution**: RMarkdown

--- 

## RMarkdown

- Combines R code and markdown
- Markdown is a plain-text formatting syntax designed to easily convert to HTML
- R code is evaluated during conversion process
- Results of r code included in document
- "Two plus two = `r 2 + 2`."

---

## RMarkdown

- Combines R code and markdown
- Markdown is a plain-text formatting syntax designed to easily convert to HTML
- R code is evaluated during conversion process
- Results of r code included in document

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Two plus two = `r 2 + 2`.
```

---

## RMarkdown

### A more complicated (and common) example

>- You come up with a brilliant idea, spend 1 year planning the design/getting funding/collecting data, spend a couple weeks analyzing the data, spend a few months preparing a manuscript, and 1 year waiting for reviews
- You get reviews
  - "You need to run more participants"
  - "You need to change the analysis"
  - "You need to quit your job"
- Problems
  - You go back to your project and don't remember anything
  - Large margin for error
  - Not reproducible

---

## RMarkdown

### ```.Rmd``` files

- Keep your code and manuscript together
- Outputs to .pdf, .doc, or .html (no more copy/paste from console to word)
- Data/results automatically updated to reflect external changes ('...run more 
participants')

## Conclusion

- R is free, extensible, and powerful
- The learning curve is rather steep, be patient
- Once you understand subsetting the rest is easy (easier?)
