# Coding standards

(and some other important stuff)

# Coding standards

### Comments

--

- You ~~should~~ have to comment your code

--

- While you are doing an analysis you feel like you know everything about your 
data. The logic of every step you take makes sense and is fresh in your mind.

--

- 6 months from now you will not remember any of that

--

- It is imperative that you obsessively comment your code

--

- Think of it as leaving little post-it notes in your script that help you 
remember your train of thought

--

- It provides a way to time stamp your progress

--

- It allows you to logically divide a script into sections

--

- It allows others to understand your code

---

# Coding standards

### Comments

- In R, comments are any characters that follow **\#** on the same line

--

.pull-left[

```{r, comments-example-1}
# This is a comment

# You can put comments above your code
x <- 2 # or next to it

x^2 # x squared
```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r, comments-example-2, fig.retina=2, fig.height=3}
# Fit a model for mpg as a function of drat
mod <- lm(mpg ~ drat, data = mtcars)

# Plot it
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_abline(intercept = coef(mod)[1], slope = coef(mod)[2])
```

# Variable naming conventions

# Coding standards

### Variable naming conventions

.pull-left[

- Similar to project/file/folder naming conventions

- Use meaningful names

- Programming language-specific prescriptivism

- Avoid caps and periods

- Use \_ for separating meaningful words

]

--

.pull-right[

.large[Ex. from R4DS]

```
i_use_snake_case
otherPeopleUseCamelCase
some.people.use.periods
And_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention
```

.small[
**My suggestion**: Use `snake_case` for everything (i.e., naming objects in R, columns in excel, etc.). You'll see why later...
]

# Coding standards

### Space

- Unlike when naming projects, folders, files, and variables, it is advisable to leave white space in some places in your scripts to make them more readable

- In general it is good practice to leave a single space before and after arguments in functions and when assigning objects
  - .red[Meh]: `x<-2`
  - .blue[Better]: `x <- 2`

--
  - .red[Meh]: `lm(mpg~drat,data=mtcars)`
  - .blue[Better]: `lm(mpg ~ drat, data = mtcars)`

--

- This is also true for markdown syntax
  - .red[Meh]: `#Introduction`
  - .blue[Better]: `# Introduction`
